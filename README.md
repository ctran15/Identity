# About the Game
The game "The Masks We Have" is a text-based game with multiple endings based on the choices the player makes as they explore the game’s narrative about multiple conflicting identities. 

# Background
My aim is to use the modeled world of my game to express the thoughts and struggles a person may encounter when dealing with their multi-identities. I want to highlight that conflicting identities can cause emotional and mental damage, but show that the situations that can cause this to happen are normal everyday life situations. I also want to highlight that even though people struggle with multi-identities, it’s okay to have them as they encompass the person. I am seeking to create a discussion among my players. I want them to walk away with a new perspective/awareness about identity.
